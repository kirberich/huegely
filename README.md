# Huegely
Huegely is a simple python library to control Philips Hue lights. It mirrors data from the hue bridge transparently, not attempting to do any caching, keeping of state, or similar. 

This is a basic first release, there are no meaningful tests and the API might change drastically. That being said, all the light functionality works.

Huegely requires python 3.x, for no good reason other than that I'm heartless.
