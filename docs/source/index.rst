Huegely is a simple python library to control Philips Hue lights. It mirrors data from the hue bridge transparently, not attempting to do any caching, keeping of state, or similar. 

This is a basic first release, there are no meaningful tests and the API might change drastically. That being said, all the lamp functionality should work.
